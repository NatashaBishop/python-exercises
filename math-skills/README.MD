To run you need install Python3, then clone the repository:   
git clone https://github.com/NatashaBishop/python-exercises/tree/fff406e3a7d46cd4952c720f53f79d2c77e00722/math-skills  
cd math-skills    
and run with command:    
math-skills> python main.py data.txt    

##The project chosen language is Python.  
The project is developed within 01Founders private coding school fellowship curriculum  

## The purpose of this project is to calculate the following:  

    Average
    Median
    Variance
    Standard Deviation

##Instructions:  

Your program must be able to read from a file and print the result of each statistic mentioned above. In other words, your program must be able to read the data present in the path passed as argument. The data in the file will be presented as the following example:

189  
113  
121  
114  
145  
110  
...

This data represents a statistical population: each line contains one value.

To run your program a command similar to this one will be used if your project is made in Go:

$> go run your-program.go data.txt

After reading the file, your program must execute each of the calculations asked above and print the results in the following manner (the following numbers are only examples):  

Average: 35  
Median: 4  
Variance: 5  
Standard Deviation: 65  

Please note that the values are rounded integers.  

##Testing:  

Your program will be tested by an auditor who will run a program provided by us. This program creates a random data set of numbers and prints the result. The auditor job is to compare how your program performed.

You can choose the language in which you want to build your program.

This project will help you learn about:

    Statistics and Mathematics
        Average
        Median
        Variance
        Standard Deviation
