# Syntax of complex() in Python: complex datatype components are: real number and imaginary number 
complex(real, imaginary)

# example1: 
real = 3
imaginary = 5
z = complex(real, imaginary)
print("The complex number is ", z)
# Output: The complex number is  (3+5j)

# example2: 
# We can also declare a Complex Data Type in Python using the string literal of type “a + bj”.
# Defining Complex Number using the string literal
complex_num = 2 + 4j
print("The complex number is ", complex_num)
# Output: The complex number is  (2+4j)

# Example 3
