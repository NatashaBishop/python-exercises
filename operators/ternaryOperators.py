#  Ternary operators also known as conditional expressions
# Ternary Operator determines if a condition is true or false and then returns appropriate value as the result
# Syntax: true_value if condition else false_value

# Example Ternary If Else:

b = 20
# python ternary operator
min = "a is minimum" if a < b else "b is minimum"
print(min)
#Output:
#a is minimum
